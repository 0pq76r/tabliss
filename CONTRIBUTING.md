# Contributing

We would love you contribute to Tabliss!

We accept issues and pull requests for both bugs and feature requests.
If your feature is larger (like a new plugin), we strongly suggest creating a
new issue to propose the new feature before you start.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, try to be as detailed as possible.

- For bugs, this could include:
  - The steps required to reproduce the bug.
- For feature requests, this could include:
  - Details of how the new feature should work
  - Links to supporting examples, references or documentation.

### Submitting a Pull Request

If you are planning on making large changes, you may be asked to sign a CLA (Contributors License Agreement).
The CLA grants us permission to use and relicense your code in Tabliss.
